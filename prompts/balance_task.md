Please help me to compose a skill to stabilize a cart pole. The cart is attached to the end effector of the robot arm. The pole rotates freely around the x-axis and is unactuated. Please stabilize the pole around the upright position (when the pole angle, denoted by PolePin, is 0) by exerting force to the cart along the y-axis. A secondary objective is to keep the end-effector pose as close as possible to [1.57078469e+00, 0.0, 1.57079455e+00, 5.96598901e-01, 1.34625984e-03, 4.33589236e-01] ([roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z]). The cart is 0.1 kg, the pole is 0.25 m, 0.01 kg.
