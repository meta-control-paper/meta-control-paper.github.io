The task at hand involved implementing a robot skill for a robotic arm to reach a specified goal position in Cartesian space while avoiding collisions in a cluttered scene. This was accomplished through a hierarchical control design involving a task controller and a tracking controller, complemented by callback functions for data conversion and routing between different system components.

### Task Controller: KinematicTrajectoryModelPredictiveController

**Objective:** Generate a safe trajectory in joint space leading the robot's end-effector to a desired pose in Cartesian coordinates, taking into account the presence of obstacles.

**Inputs:**
1. **controller_parameters**: AbstractValue (dict) containing parameters like the end-effector's goal pose.
2. **measured_arm_position**: BasicVector indicating the current joint positions of the robot.
3. **measured_arm_velocity**: BasicVector representing the current joint velocities of the robot.

**Key Parameters:**
- **resolve_period**: 3.0 seconds, determining how frequently the MPC reformulates the trajectory planning problem.
- **num_steps**: 20, denoting the number of steps in the discrete formulation of the trajectory planning problem.

### Tracking Controller: SafeController

**Objective:** Dynamically execute the trajectory computed by the task controller, adapting in real-time to avoid unforeseen obstacles.

**Inputs:**
1. **arm_target**: BasicVector specifying the desired joint positions for the robot arm.
2. **arm_target_type**: AbstractValue indicating the type of the target, set to JointTarget.kPosition.
3. **arm_position**: BasicVector for the current joint positions of the arm.
4. **arm_velocity**: BasicVector for the current joint velocities of the arm.

### Callback Functions:

#### Task Callback (`task_callback`)
Implemented to convert inputs from the skill's input ports into the format expected by the task controller.

**Functions:**
- **task_controller_parameters**: Passes through `controller_parameters` as received from the skill input.
- **task_measured_arm_position**: Directly forwards `measured_arm_position` to the task controller.
- **task_measured_arm_velocity**: Directly forwards `measured_arm_velocity` to the task controller.

#### Tracking Callback (`tracking_callback`)
Implemented to convert outputs from the task controller and inputs from the skill into the format expected by the tracking controller.

**Functions:**
- **tracking_arm_target**: Forwards the target joint positions (`task_q_nom`) computed by the task controller to the tracking controller.
- **tracking_arm_target_type**: Sets the target type to `JointTarget.kPosition`, indicating that the arm's target is specified in terms of joint positions.
- **tracking_arm_position**: Passes through `measured_arm_position` from the skill input.
- **tracking_arm_velocity**: Passes through `measured_arm_velocity` from the skill input.

### Data Flow Summary

1. `controller_parameters`, `measured_arm_position`, `measured_arm_velocity`, and other necessary measurements are input into the skill.
2. Through the task callbacks, these inputs are transformed and routed to the task controller as `controller_parameters`, `measured_arm_position`, and `measured_arm_velocity`.
3. The task controller, using the provided information, computes a trajectory that reaches the goal while avoiding obstacles.
4. The computed trajectory (`task_q_nom`) along with the original measurements (`measured_arm_position`, `measured_arm_velocity`) are fed into the tracking controller through the tracking callbacks.
5. The tracking controller executes the trajectory in real-time, adjusting as necessary to avoid collisions based on updated obstacle information.

This design ensures real-time adaptability and safety in cluttered environments, aiming for the precise achievement of task objectives. Performance metrics to assess the system could include trajectory optimality, collision avoidance efficacy, and adherence to the goal pose. Tuning may involve adjusting `controller_parameters` for task specificity, and tuning `resolve_period` and `num_steps` for trajectory planning resolution and foresight.
