For the skill of stabilizing a cart pole while maintaining the end-effector's pose, we have chosen an `LQRController` as the task controller and a `PoseForceController` as the tracking controller. These choices are adapted to meet the primary objective of stabilizing the pole around an upright position and the secondary objective of keeping the end-effector close to a desired pose. Here's how the input and output ports of these controllers would be expected to interconnect for skill execution:

### Task Controller (`LQRController`) Overview:
The `LQRController` is predetermined to regulate the dynamics of the cart-pole system. Its design favors the stabilization of the pole with minimal deviation from the upright position. The controller acts upon a linear approximation of the system dynamics using a Linear Quadratic Regulator approach.

#### Input Ports:
- **state (`BasicVector`)**: Receives the current state of the cart-pole system, represented as `[cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity]`. This input can be derived from the `measured_body_poses` and `measured_body_velocities` for the `Cart`, and `PolePin` measurements from `measured_joint_states`.

#### Constants and Parameters:
- **Model Parameters (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`)**: These matrices define the linear dynamics of the cart-pole system. For the task, these matrices would be crafted based on the mass of the cart (`m_cart`), the mass of the pole (`m_pole`), the length of the pole (`l_pole`), and the acceleration due to gravity (`g`).
- **LQR Weights (`Q`, `R`)**: The `Q` matrix places a weight on the importance of stabilizing the pole angle and angular velocity, while `R` governs the weight on the actuation effort. Adjusting these values affects how aggressively the controller acts to stabilize the pole.

### Tracking Controller (`PoseForceController`) Overview:
The `PoseForceController` aims to control the robot's end-effector to apply the necessary force to the cart while maintaining its pose. It offers a specialized mechanism to achieve goals in specific dimensions either through direct force application or pose adherence, based on the `force_control_axis_mask`.

#### Input Ports:
- **ee_pose_target (`BasicVector`)**: Targets the pose for the end-effector, structured as `[roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z]`. For dimensions where pose control is active, this would be the desired pose. This information could be mapped from the desired pose provided.
- **ee_force_target (`BasicVector`)**: Describes the target force and torque to apply along and around the end-effector's axes, also arrayed as `[roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z]`. The force to apply along the y-axis, as computed by the `LQRController`, would be placed here.
- **arm_position (`BasicVector`)**: The current positions of the robot's joints. This information would come from `measured_arm_position`.
- **arm_velocity (`BasicVector`)**: The current velocities of the robot's joints. This information would come from `measured_arm_velocity`.

#### Constants and Parameters:
- **force_control_axis_mask (`numpy.ndarray`)**: This boolean array indicates which axes of the end-effector are controlled by force `[False, False, False, False, True, False]`. Here, `True` for the y-axis signifies force control for stabilizing the cart-pole system.

### Integration:
To synthesize the controllersâ€™ operation:
- The state input for the `LQRController` (task controller) is compiled from the pole's angle and angular velocity, alongside the cart's position and velocity.
- The output from the task controller, which reflects the necessary actuation force for pole stabilization, serves as part of the input (`ee_force_target`) for the `PoseForceController` (tracking controller).
- The `PoseForceController` is also furnished with the current pose and velocity state of the arm and the desired end-effector pose.
- Finally, constant parameters like the model dynamics, LQR weights, and the force control axis mask are integral to dictating the controllers' behavior in execution.

This schematic encapsulates the necessary interfacing and parameter considerations for successful skill implementation, aiming for robustness in stabilizing the cart-pole system while attending to the end-effector's pose maintenance.
