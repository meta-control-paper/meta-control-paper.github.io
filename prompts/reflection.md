Human expert supplementary instructions: {user_explaination}

Do you think it is working as expected? (Empty output means the system is running without errors)
If it is, please answer with one word "yes".
If it is not, please identify which step(s) went wrong and explain how to fix it by including which step(s) to modify (<step_name>) and the updated code (enclosed by ```python```). We have proceeded the following steps:
- task_model
- tracking_model
- task_controller
- tracking_controller
- task_callback
- tracking_callback

Please do not makeup an inexist step.

If you decide to modify callback functions, you can only write the ones that needed to be modified. You can modify multiple steps in one go, but remember to add "<step_name>" before the corresponding code block.

Here is a sample response when it is not working as expected:

I think this error occured because [some reason].

<tracking_controller>

updated_code:
```python
tracking_controller = NewTrackingController(arg1, arg2)
```
